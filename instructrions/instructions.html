        <p>Welcome to Vault 84, the latest in a series of public defense
            works from Vault-Tec, your contractor of choice when it comes
            to the best in nuclear shelters. This document is for the events
            following a worldwide nuclear war. In such a case, this shall
            walk you step by step through surviving and eventually thriving
            in the irradiated wasteland left outside the confines of your
            Vault-Tec vault.
            When you step into the wasteland, you are on your own! Each
            survivor will need to earn experience, fight dangerous enemies,
            scavenge, trade, and complete quests to make it out there. At the
            start of your journey, you will have nothing but the vault suit
            on your back. By following this survival guide, you will grow
            in power and wealth quickly and learn to vie for influence with
            whatever factions now control the wasteland around you.</p>
